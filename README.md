Deniz - CIS196 Ruby on Rails Final Project

For my final project I decided to make a Venmo app. You can log in or create an account and send your friends payments. On your profile you can only see the people you've made payments to, not the ones you've received payments from. The name that appears above each payment notification is the person receiving the payment. So if A makes a payment to B, the name B will appear on the top of the post, but a minus will appear in front of the amount, because the person making the payment, in this case A, is losing money.

To run the project please follow the below commands:
run `rake db:migrate`
run `rake db:seed`
run `rails s`

and Enjoy :)


You can log on with the following dummy account I used for testing:
lol@penn.edu
password: password
